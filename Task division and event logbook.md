# Log book

### **Nov 22, 2025** - (all) **Meeting**

-    time: 13:00-14:00 London time

-    location: bush house L8 (the legislation lecture room)

meeting agenda:
-    check Flo data structure
-    check WeiTing GDP DNI data
-    check new scope and research questions:
(To what extent have major asian countries decoupled CO2 emissions from economic growth over the periods?
Which economic sectors (Energy, Transport, Industry) have been the primary drivers of successful (or failed) decoupling in these countries?)
-    check roadmap file(DEADLINE: 11 AM UK TIME (NOT MIDNIGHT) on THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 27th, 2025.)

### **Nov 14 2025** - (all) **Meeting**

Action item before meeting:
-    look through the emission data sheet, csv file and excel file
-    think about questions for the data and what you want to know more about, essentially they will be our topics
-    (for Marvin) design roadmap for the report development

decision:
-    compare GDP and GNI change with Energy sector CO2 emission change throughout 1970 to 2020. Region = Asia countries.

Task assignment:
-    (WeiTing) Gather GDP and GNI data for all Asia countries from 1970 to 2020, with interval of 5 years or less.
-    (Marvin) Draw roadmap for the final report
