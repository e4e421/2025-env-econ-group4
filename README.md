## Important dates
Assessment 1 - Group Coursework (40%). File formats accepted are .doc, .docx. The deadline to submit is 10:00hrs Thursday 18th December 2025. Provisional marks will be released on or after Thursday 29th January 2026.

## General 
You can find the groups for the group assignment on Keats now in the "[Assessment](https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/course/section.php?id=2202514)" section. 

Please get in touch with your group members to make sure everyone is aware of the group allocation. Ideally, you manage to meet and discuss
before our next lecture/seminar next Thursday. 

The next milestone is that you select and submit your choice of a specific policy, e.g. China's Carbon Trading Scheme, or database, e.g. EU Pollution Registry, of your choice by Monday, November 17th. Feel free to reach out via email if you would like to discuss your choice.

You will then have 1 month to work on the reports until submission on December 18th.
